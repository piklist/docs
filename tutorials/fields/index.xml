      <description>Description Piklist makes it easy to show one or more fields, based on the value of another field, and so much more. The Piklist conditions parameter is very powerful, and you can see all the options in the documentation.
In this tutorial, if the user clicks on the “Yes” radio button to subscribe to our newsletter, we will show an “Email” text field.
  Conditional fields work on almost every page in WordPress.</description>
